# Git Workflow
This repository is to understand and document the git flow process
* Git repository should be initialized with a readme file (Initial Commit)

## Setting up a code base
Here, we demonstrate the overall flow from commit to merge.
At this stage, main branch has 3 commits (Initial Commit, Updated readme.md, Setting up a code base)

### Branch 1
* Here, we add another commit namely, branch1-commit1
* Adding one more commit
* Merge this commit to main by creating a pull request
* Not deleting the branch as you would verify this. (ideally we should delete the branch once it is merged - this can be done manually or thorugh github settings)

### Branch 2 - Demonstarte 'Squash and Merge'
* Added commit 1 for branch2
* Added commit 2 for branch2  
* Now, squash and merge the 2 commits into single one by creating a pull request
